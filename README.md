# Meisunry
A minimalist, offline masonry image viewer.

Masonry layouts are super common all over the web from websites like <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/">ArtStation</a>, or <a href="https://deviantart.com">DeviantArt</a>. In terms of offline masonry viewers, the options are more limited. There are some programs like <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/123-photos-view-edit-convert/9WZDNCRDXFXG?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=1">123 Photos</a> and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4">Microsoft Photos</a>. However, I've found both of these solutions to have a bit too much in the way.

This is where <b>Meisunry</b> comes in. Choose a folder and look at your images without any unnecessary details.
